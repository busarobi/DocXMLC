\begin{abstract}
Probabilistic label trees (PLTs) have been recently introduced for solving extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) problems, i.e., multi-label problems with a very large number of labels. 
They follow the label tree approach in which each label is assigned to one and only one path from the root to a leaf. %Already a basic variant of PLTs, based on sparse input vectors, has been shown to be competitive to the state of the art approaches for XMLC, such as FastXML. 
%
In this paper, we theoretically show that PLTs are no-regret multi-label generalization of hierarchical softmax (HSM), a commonly used approach in deep networks to speed up computations in case of a large output space (such as in natural language processing problems). We also prove that the \emph{pick-one-label} heuristic often used to adapt HSM to multi-label problems is not consistent. Moreover, we empirically show that HSM with this heuristic is always worse than PLTs by a significant margin. Finally, we report the results of PLTs used with word-embeddings that are competitive to the results of more complex deep networks on a selection of XMLC benchmark datasets. 
%
%Hierarchical softmax is another label-tree approach, commonly used in deep networks to speed up computations in case of a large output sample, for example in the natural language processing problems. HSM has been, however, introduced for multi-class problems. In case of multi-label problems, a simple \emph{pick-one-label} heuristic is often used (for example, in the FastText library). Unfortunately, as we show in this paper this heuristic is suboptimal.

Many current applications of machine learning are characterized not only by a vast number of training examples and features, but also by a very large number of classes (labels) to which examples can be assigned. The learning problems of this type are often referred to as \emph{extreme classification}. They can be either multi-class or multi-label. Examples of such problems are photo and video annotation~\citep{Deng_et_al_2011} (e.g., used for image search engines), tagging of text documents~\citep{Dekel_Shamir_2010} (e.g., automatic categorization of Wikipedia articles), recommendation of bid words for online ads~\citep{Prabhu_Varma_2014}, or prediction of the next word in a sentence~\citep{Mikolov_et_al_2013}.

To be more specific, consider a problem of tagging Wikipedia articles. In this case, each article is an instance/example, words appearing in the text of articles can be considered as features, and categories to which articles are assigned as labels. By creating a data set from the current content of Wikipedia, we very easily end up with an enormous problem with millions of examples and features, but also with more than one million of labels, because that many categories are used in Wikipedia today. 

The challenges posed by the problems at that scale have opened a new line of research within machine learning. It easy to notice that the BR approach (or 1-vs-All, in general) which scales linearly with the number of labels is too costly in the extreme setting. Therefore, there is a need for new algorithms being sublinear in time and space. 

In this paper we focus on extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) of text documents. These problems are characterized by sparse textual input, usually represented in the form of a bag-of-words. 
Recently, ... word-embeddings. 


Probabilistic label trees (PLTs)~\citep{Jasinska_et_al_2016} have been recently introduced for solving extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) problems, i.e., multi-label problems with a very large number of labels. Already a basic variant of PLTs, based on sparse input vectors, has been shown to be competitive to the state of the art approaches for XMLC, such as FastXML~\citep{Prabhu_Varma_2014}. 

In a nutshell, \Algo{PLTs} are based on the label tree approach~\cite{Beygelzimer_et_al_2009a,Bengio_et_al_2010,Deng_et_al_2011} in which each label is assigned to one and only one path from the root to a leaf. Classification of a test example relies on a sequence of decisions made by node classifiers, leading the test example from the root to the leaves of the tree. Since \Algo{PLT}s are designed for multi-label classification, each internal node classifier decides whether or not to continue the path by moving to the child nodes. This is different from typical left/right decisions made in tree-based classifiers.  Moreover, a leaf node classifier needs to make a final decision regarding the prediction of a label associated to this leaf. 

\Algo{PLT}s use a class probability estimator in each node of the tree, such that an estimate of the posterior probability of a label associated with a leaf is given by the product of the probability estimates on the path from the root to that leaf. Prediction then relies on traversing the tree from the root to the leaf nodes. Whenever the intermediate value of the product of probabilities in an internal node is less than a given threshold, the subtree below this node is not explored anymore. This pruning strategy leads to a very efficient classification procedure.

As we will show in this paper \Algo{PLT}s are no-regret generalization of hierarchical softmax (HSM)~\cite{Morin_Bengio_2005} (and also of conditional probability estimation trees~\cite{Beygelzimer_et_al_2009b}) to multi-label classification. HSM is a popular approach used in deep networks to speed up computations in case of a large output space. For example, they are used in natural language processing problems such as language modeling.  

In case of multi-class distribution \Algo{PLT}s lead to exactly the same solution as HSM. This implies that that they are consistent for the 0/1 and logistic loss as shown in~\citep{Dembczynski_et_al_2016}. In case of multi-label classification \Algo{PLT}s  lead to the consistent solution for logistic loss, Hamming loss and precision@k as we will prove it in this paper. To deal with multi-label problems, HSM are often used with the \emph{pick-one-label}. We will show that this heuristic leads to suboptimal results for these three multi-label performance measures. The popularity of this heuristic may, however, be caused by the fact that in case of label independence it leads to optimal solution. In the empirical studies, we show however that HSM with this heuristic is always worse than PLTs by a significant margin. 

Finally, we also discuss how PLTs can be combined with word-embeddings and lead to very competitive results to the ones obtained by more complex deep networks on a selection of XMLC benchmark datasets. 

The paper is organized  as follows.

Historically, problems with a large number of labels were usually solved by nearest neighbor or decision tree methods. Some of today's algorithms are also based on these classical approaches, significantly extending them by a number of new tricks. If the number of labels is of order of thousands then an independent model for each class can be trained. This is the so-called {1-vs-All} approach. Unfortunately, this approach scales linearly with the number of labels, which for many applications is too costly. The extreme classification algorithms try to improve the training and prediction time, and/or the model size over the standard methods. The algorithms can be categorized to several groups based on the used paradigm such as sparsity, low-rank approximation, tree-based search, or label filtering.

In this paper we focus on tree-based algorithms, therefore we discuss them more deeply here. There are two distinct types of tree-based algorithms: decision trees and label-trees. The former type follow the idea of classical decision trees. The direct use of available decision tree algorithms, however, can be very costly \citep{Agrawal_et_al_2013}. Therefore, the FastXML algorithm~\citep{Prabhu_Varma_2014} approaches the problem in a slightly different way. It uses sparse linear classifiers in the internal tree nodes to split the feature space. The authors were able to formulate the optimization problem in a way that resulted in a very efficient algorithm. They also use an ensemble of trees to improve the overall accuracy. It is worth to underline that a leaf of the tree covers only a small region of the feature space, i.e., only a small fraction of training examples is associated with the leaf. This implies that the number of active labels in this leaf is also small (i.e., it is equal to the total number of unique labels assigned to training examples in this leaf). As a result, classification of test examples can be proceeded in a very effective way. FastXML, as well as the majority of decision tree algorithms, work in a batch mode. \citet{Choromanska_Langford_2015} have succeeded to introduce a fully online decision tree algorithm that also uses linear classifiers in the internal nodes of the tree.

In the label trees~\citep{Bengio_et_al_2010} each label corresponds to one and only one path from the root to a leaf. Two examples of algorithms following this approach are filter trees~\citep{Beygelzimer_et_al_2009a,Li_Lin_2014} and probabilistic classifiers trees~\citep{Dembczynski_et_al_2016}. It is worth noting that the latter algorithm has been introduced independently in many different research fields. In deep networks, it is known as hierarchical softmax~\citep{Morin_Bengio_2005}, in statistics as nested dichotomies~\citep{Fox_1997}, and in multi-class regression under the name of conditional probability estimation trees~\citep{Beygelzimer_et_al_2009b}. In pattern recognition a similar concept of multi-stage classifiers has also been considered~\citep{Kurzynski_1988}. Also probabilistic classifier chains~\citep{Dembczynski_et_al_2010c} introduced for minimization of 0/1 loss in multi-label classification follow this approach. Recently, this approach has been adapted to estimation of marginal probabilities in extreme multi-label problems~\citep{Jasinska_et_al_2016}, resulting in a very efficient algorithm for such performance measures as Hamming loss, precision@k and macro-averaging F-measure.

\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:formal}
\vspace{\sectionAfter}

Let $\calX$ denote an instance space, and let $\calL = \{\lambda_1,\lambda_2, \ldots,\lambda_m\}$ be a finite set of $m$ class labels. 
In the extreme setting $m$ can be of order $10^5$ and higher.
We assume that an instance $\bx \in \calX$ is associated with a subset of
labels $\calL_{\bx} \in 2^\calL$; this subset is often called the set of relevant labels, while the complement
$\calL \backslash \calL_{\bx}$ is considered as irrelevant for $\bx$. We assume $m$ to be a large number (e.g., $\ge 10^5$), but the size of the set of relevant labels $\calL_{\bx}$ is much smaller than $m$, i.e., $|\calL_{\bx}| \ll m$. We identify a set $\calL_{\bx}$ of relevant labels with a binary (sparse)
vector $\by = (y_1,y_2, \ldots, y_m)$, in which $y_i = 1 \Leftrightarrow \lambda_i \in \calL_{\bx}$. By $\calY = \{0, 1\}^m$ we denote the set of all
possible labellings.
We assume that observations $(\bx, \by)$ are generated independently and identically according to the
probability distribution $\Pr(\bX = \bx,\bY = \by)$ (denoted later by $\Pr(\bx, \by)$) defined on $\calX \times \calY$. We denote the marginal distribution of the $i$-th label by $\Pr(\bx,y_i)$. % by $\Pr_i$.

The problem of MLC can be defined as finding a  \emph{classifier} $\bh(\bx) = (h_1(\bx), h_2(\bx),\ldots, h_m(\bx))$, 
which in general can be defined as a mapping $\calX \rightarrow \calR^m$, that minimizes the \emph{expected loss} (or \emph{risk}):  
$$
\loss_\ell(\bh) = \mathbb{E}_{(\bx,\by) \sim \Pr(\bx,\by)} (\ell(\by, \bh(\bx))\,,
$$
where $\ell(\by, \hat{\by})$ is the  (\emph{task}) \emph{loss}.
%
The optimal classifier,  the so-called \emph{Bayes classifier},  for a given loss function $\ell$ is:
$$
\bh^*_\ell = \argmin_{\bh}  \loss_\ell(\bh) \,.
$$
The \emph{regret} of a classifier $\bh$ with respect to $\ell$ is defined as:
 $$
\reg_\ell(\bh) = \loss_\ell(\bh) - \loss_\ell(\bh_{\ell}^*) = \loss_\ell(\bh) - \loss_\ell^* \,.
$$
The regret quantifies the suboptimality of $\bh$ compared to the optimal classifier $\bh^*$. The goal could be then defined as finding $\bh$ with a small regret, ideally equal to zero.

In the following, we aim at estimating the marginal probabilities $\eta(\bx,j) = \Pr(y_j = 1 \given \bx)$. As we will later show marginal probabilities are a key element to optimally solve extreme classification for many complex performance measures, like Hamming loss, precision@k, and macro-F measure. 
To obtain the marginal probabilities one can use the label-wise log loss:
$$
\ell_{\log}(\by, \bh(\bx))  = \sum_{j=1}^m \ell_{\log}(h_j(\bx)) \,
$$
where 
$$
\ell_{\log}(h_j(\bx)) = y_j \log(h_j(\bx)) + (1-y_j) \log(1-h_j(\bx)) 
$$
The expected loss for a single $\bx$ (i.e., the so-called \emph{conditional risk}) in terms of the label-wise log loss is:
$$
\mathbb{E} \ell_{\log}(\bh \given \bx) =  \sum_{j=1}^m \mathbb{E}{\ell_{\log}(y, h_j(\bx))} = \sum_{j=1}^m \loss_{\log}(h_j(\bx))\,. %\\ 
$$
Therefore, the pointwise optimal prediction for the $j$-th label is:
$$
 h_j^*(\bx)  = \argmin_h \loss_{\log}(h_j(\bx)) = \eta(\bx, j) \,,
$$
since $\loss_{\log}(h_j(\bx))$ is given by:
$$
-\eta(\bx,j) \log(h_j(\bx)) - (1-\eta(\bx,j) ) \log(1 \!-\! h_j(\bx)) \,.
$$

As shown in~\citep{Dembczynski_et_al_2010}, the Hamming loss is minimized by 
$$
h_j(\bx) = \assert{\eta(\bx,j) > 0.5} \,.
$$
Macro F-measure is also optimized by predictions based on marginal probabilities. As proven in~\citep{}  to maximize the macro F-measure it suffices to find an optimal threshold on posteriors for each label separately. 

In the following, we focus on precision@k which is a standard measure in extreme classification. Formally, it is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{precision}@k(\by, \bx, \bh) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j \in \hat \calY_k} \assert{y_j = 1},
\label{eqn:precision-at-k}
\end{equation}
where $\hat \calY_k$ is a set of $k$ labels predicted by $\bh$ for $\bx$.
%
The loss function for precision$@k$ can be defined as $\ell_{p@k} = 1 - \mathrm{precision}@k$. The conditional risk is then:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\loss_{P@k}(\bh \given \bx) & = & \mathbb{E} \ell_{p@k}(\by,\bx, \bh) \\
& = & 1 - \sum_{\by \in \calY} \Pr(\by \given \bx) \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j \in \hat \calY_k} \assert{y_j = 1} \\
& = & 1 - \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j \in \hat \calY_k} \sum_{\by \in \calY} \Pr(\by \given \bx) \assert{y_j = 1} \\
& = & 1 - \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j \in \hat \calY_k} \eta(\bx,j) \,.
\end{eqnarray*}
%
The above result shows that the optimal strategy for precision$@k$ is to predict $k$ labels
with the highest conditional probabilities $\eta(\bx,j)$.

From the above results, we see that estimation of marginal probabilities is crucial for XMLC problems. To get these probabilities we can take the vanilla 1-vs-All approach trained with the label-wise log loss. Unfortunately, 1-vs-All is too costly in the extreme setting. In the following section, we shortly describe PLTs which get the marginal probabilities in an efficient way. 

%Input is given in form of document and a set of tags pairs. Documents consist of words that are taken from a dictionary which is a finite indexed set $\calW = \{ w_1, \dots , w_N \}$. A document is a sequence of words  $\bd_i = (w_{i,1}, \dots, w_{i,n_i})\in \calW^{n_i}$. Its tag set is represented  by a binary vector $\by_i = (y_{i,1}, \ldots, y_{i,m}) \in \{ 0 , 1 \}^m$ where $m$ is the number of possible tags. A set of documents is denoted by $\calD = \{ (\bw_i, \by_{i}) \}_{i=1}^n$. For sake of simplicity, we assume that $n_i = n$ for every $1\le i \le n$.
%
%Our approach consists of two modules: tagging and text representation modules. The text representation module $f : \calW^{n} \rightarrow \R^{d \times n+1}$ is a (not necessarily) parametric function whose input is a document and its output is the vector representation of both words and docs. The dimension of the representation space is $d$. In the simplest case, this text representation module can be the bag-of-words representation in which case $d=N$, and the doc vector (n+1\/th column of the image space of function $f$) is an all zero vector. A more sophisticated text representation module is the word2vec methodology which assigns a vector to each word whose dimension is typically $\le300$, and the doc representation is empty. 
%
%The tagging module's input is the output of the text presentation module, that is $g: \R^{d \times n+1} \rightarrow  \{ 0 , 1 \}^m$. 
%
%In case of Deep PLT, the text representation module simply assigns a vector $\bx_{i_j} \in \R^d$ to each word of a given document $\bd_i$, where $i_j$ is the index of the $j$\/th word of the document $i$, i.e. $f(\bd; \bx_1, \dots, \bx_N) = f(\bd) = \left[\bx_{i_1}, \dots , \bx_{i_n}, \mathbf{0}\right]$ and the document vector is zero. The labeling module is then a PLT model denoted by $g : \R^d \rightarrow  \{ 0 , 1 \}^m$ which projects the text representation to the unit vector $g( \mathbf{1}^T  f(\bd))$.
%
%DocTag2Vec is a more sophisticated model, since it makes use of document representation, however it does not make use of the text representation. The text representation module is an extended CBOW model where a document vector is added to each context that is specific to the document. Formally, the tagging module can be written as $f(\bd; \bx_1, \dots, \bx_N)=\left[\bx_{i_1}, \dots , \bx_{i_n}, \bc_i \right]$ where $\bc_i \in \R ^d$ is the representation of the document.

\section{Probabilistic label trees}
\vspace{\sectionAfter}

Let us consider a $b$-ary tree $T$ with the number of leaves corresponding to the number of labels. We denote the root of the tree by $r(T)$ and the set of leaves of a subtree rooted in node $t$ by $L(t)$. The parent node of $t$ is denoted by $\pa{t}$, and the set of child nodes by $\Children{t}$. The path from the root $r(T)$ to an node $t$, either an internal or a leaf node, is denoted by $\Path{t}$. 
%A path for a leaf node $j \in L(r(T))$ corresponds to one and only one label. 
%
Each label $j$ is uniquely identified by a path $\Path{j}$ from the root to the $j$\/th leaf. %This implies that the number of leaves corresponds to the number of labels. 

The $\Path{j}$ is used by \Algo{PLT}s to estimate the posterior probability $\eta(\bx, j)$.
With each node $t$ and training instance $\bx$, we associate a label $z_t = \assert{\textstyle \sum_{j \in L(t)} y_j \ge 1}$.
In the leaf nodes, the labels $z_j$, $j \in L$, correspond to the original labels $y_j$.
Using the chain rule of probability, we can express $\eta(\bx, j)$ in the following way:
\begin{equation}
\eta(\bx, j) = \prod_{t \in \Path{j}} \eta_T(\bx, t)\,,
\label{eqn:probabilistic_tree}
\end{equation}
where $\eta_T(\bx, t) = \prob(z_t = 1 \given z_{\pa{t}} =1, \bx)$ for all non-root nodes $t$, and $\eta_T(\bx, t) = \prob(z_t = 1 \given \bx)$ if $t$ is the root node. 
The correctness of (\ref{eqn:probabilistic_tree}) follows from the observation that $z_{t} = 1$ implies $z_{\pa{t}} = 1$. A detailed derivation of the chain rule in this setup is given in Appendix~\ref{app:plt}.

Training of \Algo{PLT}s can be performed independently for each node, either in batch or online mode.  Algorithm~\ref{alg:plt-training} presents the procedure for online learning. As input it takes a structure of the tree $T$, set $\calD$ of training examples, and a chosen variant $A$ of stochastic gradient descent~\cite{Bottou_2010}. In the main \textbf{for} loop, it assigns each training example $(\bx, \by)$ to corresponding nodes (such that  $z_{\pa{t}} = 1$, see line 4) and updates their classifiers (line 5). This assignment can be easily performed by traversing the tree from the root node to the leaves corresponding to the positive labels of a training example. The number of updated node classifiers is upper bounded by $s \times b \times h+1$, where $b$ and $h$ denote the degree and height of the tree, respectively, and $s$ is the number of positive labels in $\by$. For sparse labels, this value is much lower than $m$.

%Since the training example is used in a node $t$ only if $t$ is the root or $z_{\pa{t}} = 1$, this number is upper bounded by $s\cdot b \cdot k+1$, where $b$ and $k$ denote the degree and height of the tree, respectively, and $s$ is the number of positive labels in $\by$. For sparse labels, this value is much lower than $m$.

%Remark that the  line 4 can be updates an appropriate node classifie As input Let $\calD_n = \{ (\bx_i, \by_{i}) \}_{i=1}^n$ be a training set of multi-label examples.
%To learn classifiers in all nodes of a tree $T$, we need to properly filter training examples to estimate $\eta_T(\bx,t)$ (line 5).

%The learning time complexity of \Algo{PLT}s can be expressed in terms of the number of nodes in which an original training example $(\bx,\by)$ is used. Since the training example is used in a node $t$ only if $t$ is the root or $z_{\pa{t}} = 1$, this number is upper bounded by $s\cdot b \cdot k+1$, where $b$ and $k$ denote the degree and height of the tree, respectively, and $s$ is the number of positive labels in $\by$. For sparse labels, this value is much lower than $m$. Note that learning can be performed simultaneously for all nodes, and each node classifier can be trained using online methods, such as stochastic gradient descent~\cite{Bottou_2010}.

To get prediction suited for precision@k, Algorithm~\ref{alg:pt-prediction} traverses the tree to find top $k$ labels. To this end it starts with adding the root node along with the probability returned by its classifier to a priority queue $Q$. Then, in the \textbf{while} loop, the algorithm pops from $Q$ a node $t$ with the highest intermediate probability (i.e., the probability $\heta(\bx, t) = \prod_{j \in \Path{t}} \heta_T(\bx, j)$). If this node is a leaf, then the corresponding label will be added to the final prediction. Otherwise, its children nodes will be added to $Q$ with the corresponding probabilities $\heta(\bx, c)$, $c \in \Children{t}$. The prediction stops after finding top k labels. 

%Prediction with probabilistic label trees relies on estimating (\ref{eqn:probabilistic_tree}) by traversing the tree from the root to the leaf nodes. However, if the intermediate value of this product in node $t$, denoted by $p_t$, is less than a given threshold $\tau$, then the subtree starting in node $t$ is no longer explored. For the sake of completeness, we shortly describe this procedure (see Algorithm~\ref{alg:pt-prediction}). We start with setting $\hat{\by} = \vec{0}_m$. In order to traverse a tree, we initialize a queue $Q$ to which we add the root node $r_T$ with its posterior estimate $\heta_T(\bx,r(T))$. In the while loop, we iteratively pop a node from $Q$ and compute $p_t$. If $p_t \ge \tau$, we either set $\hat{y}_j = 1$ if $t$ is a leaf, or otherwise add its child nodes to $Q$ with the value $p_t$ multiplied by their posterior estimates $\heta_T(\bx, c)$, $c \in \Children{t}$. If $Q$ is empty, we stop the search and return $\hat{\by}$.

Traversing a label tree can be much cheaper than querying $m$ independent classifiers, one for each label. To find the label with the highest marginal probability, \Algo{PLT} ideally needs to call only $b\times h+1$ classifiers (all $h$ classifiers on a path of from the root to a leaf plus all classifiers in the siblings nodes). Of course, in the worst-case scenario, the entire tree might be explored, but even then, no more than $2 \times m-1$ calls are required (with $m$ leaves, the size of the tree is upper bounded by $2 \times m-1$). In the case of sparse label sets, \Algo{PLT}s can significantly speed up the classification procedure. The expected cost of prediction depends, however, on the tree structure and the accuracy of node classifiers.

\subsection{Theoretical guarantees}
\label{sec:regret}
\vspace{\sectionAfter}

As proven in~\citep{Jasinska_et_al_2016}  \Algo{PLT}s obey strong theoretical guarantees. It has been shown that the absolute difference between the true and the estimated marginal probability of label $j$, $|\eta(\bx,j) - \heta(\bx,j)|$ can be upperbounded by the loss of the inner node classifiers. This also means that for optimal node classifiers, we obtain an optimal multi-label classifier in terms of estimation of posterior probabilities $\eta(\bx,j)$. In this paper, we extend this result to give guarantees for precision@k. 

Let us denote the top k labels with respect to the true marginals by $\calY_k$ and the top k labels with respect to predicted marginals by $\hat \calY_k$.
Conditional regret for precision@k is given by:
$$
\reg_{p@k} (\bh \given \bx) = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i \in \calY_k} \eta (\bx ,i ) - \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j \in \hat \calY_k} \eta(\bx , j )
$$

%We shall focus on multi-label classifiers in the following form:
%\[
%h(\bx,i) =h_{k, \hat{\eta}}(\bx,i) = \assert{\textstyle i \in \hat{M}_k(\bx) }
%\]
%
%In this case the Prec@k regret is $[0,1]$.

We can upper bound $\reg_{p@k} (\bh \given \bx)$ by noticing that $\hat \calY_k$ does not contain label $i \in \calY_k$ when for all $j \in \hat \calY_k$ we have:
$$
\heta(\bx, i) < \heta(\bx,j) \,. % \quad \mathrm{and} \quad \,.
$$
To use the upper bound of $m_j = |\eta(\bx,j) - \heta(\bx,j)|$ we can write 
$$
\eta(\bx, i) - \eta(\bx, i) + \heta(\bx, i)  < \eta(\bx,j) - \eta(\bx,j) + \heta(\bx,j) \,,
$$
which gives us 
$$
\eta(\bx, j) > \eta(\bx, i) - \eta(\bx, i) + \heta(\bx, i) + \eta(\bx,j) - \heta(\bx,j) \,. \\
$$
Since we know that $\eta(\bx, i) > \eta(\bx, j)$, for all $j \in \calY_k$, we can rearrange the terms and write:
$$
\eta(\bx, j)  > \eta(\bx, i) - |\eta(\bx, i) - \heta(\bx, i)| - |\eta(\bx,j) - \heta(\bx,j)| \,. 
$$
Finally, we obtain:
$$
\eta(\bx, j) > \eta(\bx, i) - m_i - m_j < \eta(\bx,i) - 2 \max_{l} m_l \,. %|\eta(\bx, i) - \heta(\bx, i)| + |\eta(\bx,j) - \heta(\bx,j)| \,.
$$
%as we know that $\eta(\bx, i) > \eta(\bx, j)$ for all $j \in \calY_k$.
%where $m_i = |\eta(\bx,i) - \heta(\bx,i)|$. 
%This is because that the true top label j can be replaced by label k in the worse case when \eta_j - m_j < \eta_k + m_k.
%$m_j = |\eta(\bx,j) - \heta(\bx,j)|$ in the following way 
The regret can be then written as follows:
\begin{align*}
\reg_{p@k} (\bh \given \bx)
  & = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i \in \calY_k} \eta (\bx ,i) - \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j \in \hat \calY_k} \eta(\bx , j )  \\
  & \le \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i \in \calY_k} \eta (\bx ,i) - \eta(\bx,i) - 2 \max_{l} m_l \\
  & \le 2 \max_{l} m_l 
\end{align*}
%\sum_{i \in M_k(\bx)} \eta (\bx ,i ) - \sum_{j \in [m]} h(\bx, j) \eta(\bx , j ) \notag \\
%  & \le \sum_{i \in M_k(\bx)} \hat{\eta} (\bx ,i ) + m_i - \sum_{j \in [m]} h(\bx, j) \eta(\bx , j ) \notag \\ 
%  & \le \sum_{i \in \hat{M}_k(\bx)} (\hat{\eta} (\bx ,i ) + m_i )- \sum_{j \in \hat{M}_k(\bx)}  \eta(\bx , j ) \notag \\
%  & = \sum_{i \in \hat{M}_k(\bx)} 2m_i \notag \\
%  & \le 2k\max_{i \in [m]} m_i
%\end{align}

The more detailed derivation can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:plt}.  
%we derive a surrogate regret bound showing that the overall error of \Algo{PLT}s is reduced by improving the node classifiers.

\subsection{Correction of probability estimates}
\label{sec:correction}
\vspace{\sectionAfter}

The resulting marginal probabilities of PLT, or in general all node probabilities, may not correspond to a valid underlying multi-label distribution. Let us consider a node $t$ and the estimated probability of at least 1 positive label in its subtree: 
$$
\heta(\bx, t) = \prod_{j \in \Path{t}} \heta_T(\bx, j)
$$
This probability in case of a leaf node $j$ is just the marginal probability $\heta(\bx, j)$ of the label $j$ being positive.
In general, the estimated probabilities for a non-leaf node $t$ and its children nodes should satisfy the following constraints: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& \heta(\bx, t)  \ge \heta(\bx, c)\,, \forall c \in \Children{t}\,, \\
&& \heta(\bx, t)  \le \sum_{c \in \Children{t}}  \heta(\bx, c) \,. 
\end{eqnarray*}
The first constraint is trivially satisfied by the algorithm since 
$$
\heta(\bx, c) = \heta(\bx, t) \heta_T(\bx, c)\,,\mathrm{~and~}  \heta_T(\bx, c) \in [0,1]\,.
$$ 
The problem is the second constraint. A possible solution is to do the following simple trick. Let 
$$
s = \sum_{c \in \Children{t}} \heta(\bx, c) \,.
$$
Then, if $s < \heta(\bx, t)$ the probabilities $\heta(\bx, c)$, for all $c \in \Children{t}$, should be corrected according to:
$$
\heta(\bx, c) := \heta(\bx, c) \frac{\heta(\bx, t)}{s}\,.
$$
%Another option is:
%$$
%\heta(\bx, c) := \heta(\bx, c) + \frac{s - \heta(\bx, t)}{|\Children{t}|}\,.
%$$

%In general the constraints in a $b$-ary tree for a node $t$ and its children nodes should be of the following type:
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%&& \prod_{j \in \Path{t}} \heta_T(\bx, j) \ge \prod_{j \in \Path{c}} \heta_T(\bx, j)\,,~c \in \Children{t}\,, \\
%&& \prod_{j \in \Path{t}} \heta_T(\bx, j) \le \sum_{c \in \Children{t}}  \prod_{j \in \Path{c}} \heta_T(\bx, c) \,, 
%\end{eqnarray*}
%where $t$ is a non-leaf node. %$p_pa$ is the probability in the parent node and $p_j$ is the probability in its$ $j-th child node.
%The first constraint is satisfied by the algorithm since 
%$$
%\prod_{j \in \Path{c}} \heta_T(\bx, j) = \heta_T(\bx, c) \prod_{j \in \Path{\pa{c}}} \heta_T(\bx, j)\,.
%$$ 
%%
%The problem is the second constraint. A possible solution is to do the following simple trick. Let 
%$$
%s = \sum_{j=1}^k p_j\,.
%$$
%Then, if $s < p_{pa}$ the probabilities $p_j$, for all $j = 1, \ldots, k$, should be corrected according to:
%$$
%p_j = \frac{p_j \times p_{pa}}{s}\,.
%$$

\subsection{Generalization of HSM}
\label{sec:online_PLTs}
\vspace{\sectionAfter}

Hierarchical softmax (HSM) (and conditional probability estimation trees as well) is designed for multi-class classification. In this section, we show that \Algo{PLT}s are proper generalization of HSM to multi-label classification. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:regret}, PLTs are consistent in estimation of marginal probabilities and for maximization of precision@k in the multi-label setting. However, in case of a multi-class distribution, they get exactly the same model as HSM. In sake of simplicity, we will consider a binary tree in the following.

		\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{PLTs generalizes HSM}
\label{fig:plt-vs-hsm}
\end{figure}
%
Let us consider probabilities in sibling nodes, $l$ and $r$, as in Figure~\ref{fig:plt-vs-hsm}:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\eta_T(\bx, l) & = & \prob(z_l = 1 \given z_{\pa{l}} =1, \bx)\,,  \\
\eta_T(\bx, r) & = & \prob(z_r = 1 \given z_{\pa{r}} =1, \bx)\,.
\end{eqnarray*}
Since $\pa{l} = \pa{r}$ (as $l$ and $r$ sibling nodes, they need to have the same parent), the condition in the both probabilities above is the same. Moreover, since $z_{\pa{r}} =1$ there is at least one active label in the subtree rooted in the parent of $r$ and $l$. Since we deal with multi-class distribution, there is exactly one such label. This further implies that $z_l + z_r = 1$, and finally: 
\begin{equation}
\eta_T(\bx, l)+ \eta_T(\bx, r) = 1 \,.
\label{eqn:sibling_summation}
\end{equation}
In other words, the model in node $l$ is the complement of the model in node $r$, i.e., both sibling nodes can be collapsed to one node with one model with the left and right decision. This is then exactly the model used is binary HSM. Let us also notice that this reasoning can be nicely generalized further to $b$-ary trees.

%Summarizing the above To summarize, It uses a similar tree, but without node classifiers in leaves. To compute the probability of the $j$-th label it also uses (\ref{eqn:probabilistic_tree}), but with $\heta(\bx, j)$ being set to 1, and the sibling probabilities summing to one (\ref{eqn:sibling_summation}). 

\vspace{\sectionBefore}
\subsection{Suboptimality of the pick-one-label heuristic}
\label{sec:online_PLTs}
\vspace{\sectionAfter}

%FastText also uses HSM. 
To deal with multi-label problems HSM is often applied with the pick-one-label heuristic that randomly picks one of the labels for a given training instance. The training instance is then treated as a multi-class instance. During prediction, the heuristic returns a multi-class distribution and the most probable label only. It can be easily extended to return the top $k$ labels as in case of PLT. We will show that this approach is not consistent in general. 

%It can be easily shown that PLTs are consistent for any multi-label probability distribution $\prob$ (including the multi-class distributions).  

%This is not a case of the pick-one-label heuristic used for HSM. 
The pick-one-label heuristic maps the multi-label distribution to a multi-class distribution in the following way:\footnote{We use the same notation for the probability of the $i$-th label in the multi-class distribution as the marginal probability of the multi-label distribution, since the multi-class distribution can be also coded by vectors $\by$, but with a constraint that one and only one label is active.}
\begin{equation}
\eta'(\bx, j) = \prob'(y_j = 1 \given \bx) = \sum_{\by \in \calY} y_j \frac{\prob(\by \given \bx)}{\sum_{j'=1}^m y_{j'}}
\label{eq:heuristic}
\end{equation}
This is specific marginalization with respect to $y_j$ in which we divide the conditional probability of  $\prob(\by \given \bx)$ by the number of ones in $\by$. To see that the pick-one-label does not lead to the optimal solution let us consider the following conditional distribution for some $\bx$ given in the table below.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c}
\toprule
labels $\by$ & probability $\prob(\by \given \bx)$ \\
\midrule
$\{1\}$ & 0.15 \\
$\{2\}$ & 0.1 \\
$\{1, 2\}$ & 0.25 \\
$\{3\}$ & 0.3 \\
$\{4\}$ & 0.2 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The optimal top 1 prediction for this example is obviously label $1$, since the marginal probabilities are $\eta(\bx,1) = 0.4, \eta(\bx,2) = 0.35,  \eta(\bx,3) = 0.3, \eta(\bx,4) =0.2$. However, the pick-one-label heuristic will transform the original distribution to the following one: $\eta'(\bx,1) = 0.275, \eta'(\bx,2) = 0.225,  \eta'(\bx,3) = 0.3, \eta'(\bx,4) =0.2$. The predicted top label will be then label $3$, giving the regret of 0.1. This shows that the heuristic is consistent neither for label-wise logistic loss nor precision@k. 

%splits the probability of labels $\{1,2\}$ to half probabilities of $\{1\}$ and $\{2\}$ yielding the following marginal probabilities: $\eta(\bx,1) = 0.275, \eta(\bx,2) = 0.225,  \eta(\bx,3) = 0.3, \eta(\bx,4) =0.2$. 

In general, it is obvious that the heuristic changes the marginal probabilities of labels, unless the distribution is multi-class. 
Interestingly, if the labels are conditionally independent, i.e.,:
$$
\prob(\by \given \bx) = \prod_{j=1}^m \prob(y_i \given \bx)\,,
$$
the optimal solution in terms of precision@k will not change. To show this let us observe the following.
Let $y_i$ and $y_j$ be so that $\prob(y_i = 1 \given \bx) \ge \prob(y_j = 1 \given \bx) $. Then in the summation over all $\by$s in (\ref{eq:heuristic}), we are interested in four different subsets of $\calY$: 
$$
S_{i,j}^{u,w}  =  \{\by\in \calY: y_i = u \land y_j = w\} \quad u,w \in \{0,1\} \,.
$$
During mapping any $\by \in S^{0,0}_{i,j}$ does not play any role. For each $\by \in S^{1,1}_{i,j}$, the value of 
$$
y_t \frac{\prob(\by \given \bx)}{\sum_{t'=1}^m y_{t'}}
$$ 
is the same for both $y_i$ and $y_j$. Now, let $\by' \in S^{1,0}_{i,j}$ and $\by'' \in S^{0,1}_{i,j}$ be the same on all elements except the $i$-th and the $j$-th one. Then, because   $\prob(y_i = 1 \given \bx) \ge \prob(y_j = 1 \given \bx) $, we will have $\prob(\by' \given \bx) \ge \prob(\by'' \given \bx)$. Therefore, after mapping we will get $\eta'(\bx,i) \ge \eta'(\bx, j)$. 
Thus, for this specific situation of independent labels, the pick-one-label heuristic is consistent for precision@k.

\section{PLTs for document tagging}
\label{sec:tagging_PLTs}
\vspace{\sectionAfter}


PLTs can be combined with various underlying document representations. In this section we briefly describe sample applications of PLTs to document tagging. 
The described approaches differ mainly in the representation of a document, and therefore in the architecture of the entire model. In principle PLTs work the same in each of them, however in certain cases the application must be suited for the architecture.

All the examples consist of two modules: text representation and tagging, as presented on the schema on Figure~\ref{pic:module-repres-module-tag}. The text representation module $f : \calW^{n} \rightarrow \R^{d \times n}$ is a (not necessarily) parametric function whose input is a document and its output is the vector representation of the document. The dimension of the representation space is $d$. 
The input of the tagging input is the output of the text representation module, that is $g: \R^{d \times n} \rightarrow  \{ 0 , 1 \}^m$.

%\subsection{Online training of PLTs}
%\label{sec:online_PLTs}
%\vspace{\sectionAfter}
%
%PLTs can be trained by using online algorithms such as different variants of stochastic gradient descent~\citep{Bottou_2010}. This is because each node can be trained in isolation (there is no dependence between node classifiers). Since the goal is to train a model for estimating probabilities $\heta_T(\bx,j)$, one can use any algorithm that minimizes log and squared error loss. By appropriate assignment of training examples to nodes (as in Algorithm~\ref{alg:plt-training}) we can easily observe that the node classifiers can be updated in online manner. 
%This is important as in case of text classification problems we usually deal with data sets of a large number of examples (i.e., text documents). Moreover, a PLT can also be easily used as the last layer in a deep or shallow neural network. 
%
%%To apply PLTs to large data and neural networks an online training algorithm is necessary.
%%The online training algorithm for PLTs is given in Algorithm \ref{algo:plt-train}. 
%%Let $(\bx, \by)$ be a training example. The online update of a PLT requires finding the sum, denoted with  $N_{path}$, of the sets of nodes on $\Path{y_i}$ for all $y_i \in \mathcal{P}(\by)$. The set of neighbors of nodes in $N_{path}$ that are not in $N_{path}$ is denoted with $N_{\lnot path}$. All nodes in $N_{path}$ are updated with $(\bx, 1)$, and all the nodes in $N_{\lnot path}$ with $(\bx, 0)$. The described learning algorithm can be applied to many different underlying models for document representation.

\subsection{PLTs with sparse input}
\label{sec:sparse_input}
\vspace{\sectionAfter}

In the simplest case PLTs can be used on sparse representation of text. In other words, the text representation module $f$ can transform text to bag-of-words representation, in which case $d=N$. However, on average the number of non-zero features $\overline{\mathrm{nnz}}(\bx) \ll N$, and the documents are represented as sparse matrices. %The training is a direct application of the training Algorithm \ref{algo:plt-train}.
There are two possibilities how to work with the sparse representation. When batch training is feasible, one can train the models effectively one by one, or in parallel, in a dense format, and then store them in a sparse format. However, when online training is required, it is necessary use of feature hashing~\citep{Weinberger_et_al_2009} to make the memory requirements feasible. 

Interestingly, in the case of sparse features, the space complexity can be significantly reduced as well. Admittedly, the number of models is the highest for binary trees and can be as high as $2m-1$ (notice that the size of a tree with $m$ leaves is upper bounded by $2m-1$). This is twice the number of models in the simplest 1-vs-all approach. Paradoxically, the space complexity can be the lowest at this upper bound. This is because only the sibling nodes need to share the same features, while no other features are needed to build corresponding classifiers. Therefore, only those (few) features needed to describe the sibling labels have to be used in the models. If the space complexity still exceeds the available memory, one can always use feature hashing over all nodes \cite{Weinberger_et_al_2009}.

\subsection{PLTs with word embeddings}
\label{sec:sparse_input}
\vspace{\sectionAfter}

Instead of the sparse representation we can also use a dense representation being a result of a deep or shallow neural network.
One possibility is to use pretrained word embeddings, like word2vec~\citep{word2vec} or glove~\citep{glove}. This idea is presented on Figure~\ref{pic:model-embedding}. The document representation can be created from the word representations in many ways, i.e, as an average \cite{!} or as the maximum or minimum value of each element \cite{!}.

It is possible to train the word embeddings simultaneously with the tagger module, similarly as in FastText~\citep{}. Depending on the application and the size of the text corpus this might be either inferior or superior to the former approach. Another option is to initiate the network with the pre-trained values and then update all the parameters of both the tagging and text representation module. 
%but such approach leads to serious lengthening of the training time \cite{!!} and often to worse results\cite{!!}. This is not surprising since the pretrained word embeddings represent knowledge transfered from larger text corpora then the tagging datasets.

To improve the document representation, instead of a simple average over words, we feed the embeddings of consecutive words into an LSTM newtork~\citep{!}. The output of the LSTM is then input of the tagger.

\subsection{Comparison of PLTs and HSM on synthetic data}
\label{sec:empirical-synthetic}

To validate the theoretical results we perform a comparison of PLTs and HSM on synthetic datasets of three types: multi-label with conditionally dependent labels, multi-label with independent labels, and multi-class. The empirical results are given in Table \ref{tab:synthetic1}. The methods used to generate the data are given below.

The independent multi-label data was generated from a multi-label OvR model. Example features $\bx$ were generated by uniformly drawing from $[-0.5, 0.5]^d$. The OvR weights $W$ were drawn uniformly from  $[-0.5, 0.5]^{d \times m}$.
%, where $s$ stands for a shift used to control the average probability of a positive label. 
The score $a =\bx w_i$ of $i$-th label was then transformed to a probability $p_i(a) = \frac{1}{(1 + exp(-a))}$, and the $i$-th label was drawn with the probability $p_i$.

% The conditionally dependent multi-label data was generated from the PCC \cite{!} model. Example features were drawn as in the previous paragraph. The PCC model weights were drawn from  $[-0.5, 0.5]^{(d + m) \times m}$.
% %, also with the use of a shift $s$. 
% The score of $i$-th label was computed based on it's features and all the previous labels $j$ as $d+j$-th features, set to -$q$ or $q$ depending on the results of the draws with labels probabilities. The value of $q$, usually set to $0.5$, is related to the degree of dependence between labels.


The conditionally dependent multi-label data was generated according to the following model:
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{f} = \boldsymbol{A }\bx + \epsilon 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\by = \assert{\boldsymbol{M} \boldsymbol{f} >  0  },
\end{equation*}

\noindent
where $\boldsymbol{f} = (f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_m)$ represent $m$ latent variables, $\boldsymbol{M}$ a mixing matrix, and $\epsilon$ a noise introducing label dependencies. The two-dimensional feature vector $\bx$ was drawn uniformly from a unit disc, the linear coefficients $A$ uniformly from two-dimensional unit sphere. The noise $\epsilon$ is a $m$-dimensional vector drawn from $N(0, 0.25)$, and the $m \times m$ mixing matrix $\boldsymbol{m}$ i.i.d. from $[-1, 1]$. To make the labels dependent $\boldsymbol{M} \neq \boldsymbol{I}$.

The multi-class data was generated based on the same model as independent multi-label data, OvR, but we selected the label with the highest probability, instead of drawing $m$ times.

\section{Regret for Prec@k}


Precision@k is formally defined as:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{precision}@k(\by, \bx, \bh) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j \in \calY_k} \assert{y_j = 1},
\label{eqn:precision-at-k}
\end{equation}
where $\calY_k$ is a set of $k$ labels predicted by $\bh$ for $\bx$.
%
The loss function for precision$@k$ is $\ell_{p@k} = 1 - \mathrm{precision}@k$. The conditional risk for this loss is given by:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\loss_{P@k}(\bh \given \bx) & = & \mathbb{E} \ell_{p@k}(\by,\bx, \bh) \\
& = & 1 - \sum_{\by \in \calY} \Pr(\by \given \bx) \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j \in \calY_k} \assert{y_j = 1} \\
& = & 1 - \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j \in \calY_k} \sum_{\by \in \calY} \Pr(\by \given \bx) \assert{y_j = 1} \\
& = & 1 - \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j \in \calY_k} \eta(\bx,j) \,.
\end{eqnarray*}
%
The above result shows that the optimal strategy for precision$@k$ is to predict $k$ labels
with the highest conditional probabilities $\eta(\bx,j)$.


Top-k labels with respect to the true marginals
\[
M_k(\bx) = \left\{ i\in [m] : \# \left\{ j \in [m] : \eta(\bx, j) \ge \eta(\bx, i)  \right\} \le k\right\}
\]

Top-k labels with respect to the estimated marginals
\[
\hat{M}_k(\bx) = \left\{ i\in [m] : \# \left\{ j \in [m] : \hat{\eta}(\bx, j) \ge \hat{\eta}(\bx, i)  \right\} \le k\right\}
\]


Expected regret for Prec@k conditioned on $\bx$ 
\[
\mbox{Reg}_{P@k} (h, \bx) = \sum_{i \in M_k(\bx)} \eta (\bx ,i ) - \sum_{j \in [m]} h(\bx, j) \eta(\bx , j )
\]

We shall focus on multi-label classifiers in the following form:
\[
h(\bx,i) =h_{k, \hat{\eta}}(\bx,i) = \assert{\textstyle i \in \hat{M}_k(\bx) }
\]

In this case the Prec@k regret is $[0,1]$.

The error for marginal estimates is denoted by $m_i = \vert \eta (\bx ,i ) - \hat{\eta} (\bx ,i )\vert$. With this we can upper bound 
\begin{align}
\mbox{Reg}_{P@k} (h, \bx) 
  & = \sum_{i \in M_k(\bx)} \eta (\bx ,i ) - \sum_{j \in [m]} h(\bx, j) \eta(\bx , j ) \notag \\
  & \le \sum_{i \in M_k(\bx)} \hat{\eta} (\bx ,i ) + m_i - \sum_{j \in [m]} h(\bx, j) \eta(\bx , j ) \notag \\ 
  & \le \sum_{i \in \hat{M}_k(\bx)} (\hat{\eta} (\bx ,i ) + m_i )- \sum_{j \in \hat{M}_k(\bx)}  \eta(\bx , j ) \notag \\
  & = \sum_{i \in \hat{M}_k(\bx)} 2m_i \notag \\
  & \le 2k\max_{i \in [m]} m_i
\end{align}

\section{Probabilistic label trees}
\label{app:plt}

An example of a probabilistic label tree (\Algo{PLT}) for 4 labels $(y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4)$ is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:plt}. To estimate posterior probability $\eta(\bx, j) = \prob(y_j = 1 \given \bx)$, \Algo{PLT} uses a path from a root to the $j$-th leaf.
In each node $t$, we associate with a training instance $(\bx,\by)$ a label $z_t$ such that:
$$
z_t = \assert{\textstyle \sum_{j \in L(t)} y_j \ge 1} \quad \textrm{(or equivalently $z_t = \bigvee_{j \in L(t)} y_j$)}
$$
Recall that $L(t)$ is a set of all leaves of a subtree with the root in the $t$-th node. In leaf nodes the labels $z_j$, $j \in L$, correspond to original labels $y_j$.

%

Consider the leaf node $j$ and the path from the root to this leaf node. Using the chain rule of probability, we can express $\eta(\bx, j)$ in the following way:
\begin{equation}
\eta(\bx, j) = \prod_{t \in \Path{j}} \eta_T(\bx, t)\,,
\label{eqn:probabilistic_tree_appendix}
\end{equation}
where $\eta_T(\bx, t) = \prob(z_t = 1 \given z_{\pa{t}} =1, \bx)$, for all non-root nodes $t$, and $\eta(\bx, t) = \prob(z_t = 1 \given \bx)$, if $t$ is the root node (denoted by $r(T)$). 

To see the correctness of (\ref{eqn:probabilistic_tree_appendix}) notice that $z_{t} = 1$ implies $z_{\pa{t}} = 1$. So, for non-root nodes $t$ and $\pa{t}$ we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\eta_T(\bx,t) \eta_T(\bx, \pa{t}) & = &  \prob(z_t = 1 \given z_{\pa{t}} =1, \bx)\prob(z_{\pa{t}} = 1 \given z_{\pa{\pa{t}}} =1, \bx)\\
& = & \frac{\prob(z_t = 1 , z_{\pa{t}} =1, \bx)}{\prob(z_{\pa{t}} =1, \bx)} \frac{\prob(z_{\pa{t}} = 1, z_{\pa{\pa{t}}} =1, \bx)}{\prob(z_{\pa{\pa{t}}} =1, \bx)} \\
& = & \frac{\prob(z_t = 1, \bx)}{\prob(z_{\pa{t}} =1, \bx)} \frac{\prob(z_{\pa{t}} = 1, \bx)}{\prob(z_{\pa{\pa{t}}} =1, \bx)} \\
& = & \frac{\prob(z_t = 1, \bx)}{\prob(z_{\pa{\pa{t}}} =1, \bx)} \,.
\end{eqnarray*}
In words, the probability associated with the parent node $\pa{t}$ cancels out and we can express $\eta_T(\bx,t) \eta_T(\bx, \pa{t})$ as the product of probabilities associated only with node $t$ and its grandparent node $\pa{\pa{t}}$. 
%
Applying the above rule consecutively to $\prod_{t \in \Path{j}} \eta_T(\bx, t)$ and recalling that for the root note $\eta_T(\bx, r(T)) = \prob(z_{r(T)} = 1 \given \bx)$, we finally get $\eta(\bx, j)$. 

Below we show that \Algo{PLT}s posses strong theoretical guarantees. We derive a relation between  estimation error minimized by the node classifiers and estimation error of posterior probabilities $\eta(\bx,j)$. This relation states that we can upperbound the latter error by the former. This also implies that for optimal node classifiers we get optimal multi-label classifier in terms of estimation of posterior probabilities.

We are interested in bounding the estimation error of posterior probabilities of labels at point $\bx$
$$
\ell(\eta(\bx),\heta(\bx)) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m |\eta(\bx, j) - \heta(\bx, j)| \,,
$$
in terms of an estimation error of node classifiers
$$
\ell(\eta_T(\bx, t), \heta_T(\bx, t)) = |\eta_T(\bx, t) - \heta_T(\bx, t)  | \,.
$$

Expressing $\eta(\bx, j)$  and $\heta(\bx, j)$ by (\ref{eqn:probabilistic_tree_appendix}) and applying Lemma~2 from~\cite{Beygelzimer_et_al_2009b}, we get:
\begin{equation}
\left | \eta(\bx, j) - \heta(\bx, j) \right | \le \sum_{t \in \Path{j}} \left | \eta_T(\bx, t) - \heta_T(\bx, t) \right | \,.
\label{eqn:estimation_bound}
\end{equation}

Equation (\ref{eqn:estimation_bound}) already shows that minimization of the estimation error by node classifiers improves the overall performance of \Algo{PLT}s. We can show, however, even a more general result concerning surrogate regret bounds by referring to the theory of  strongly proper composite losses~\cite{Agarwal_2014}. 

Assume that a node classifier has a form of a real-valued function $f_t$. Moreover, there exists a strictly increasing (and therefore invertible) link function $\psi: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f_t(\bx) = \psi(\heta_T(\bx,t))$. Recall that the regret of $f_t$ in terms of a loss function $\ell$ at point $\bx$ is defined as:
$$
\reg_{\ell}(f_t \given \bx) = L_{\ell}(f_t \given \bx) - L_{\ell}^*(\bx) \,,
$$
where $L_{\ell}(f_t \given \bx)$ is the expected loss  at  point $\bx$:
$$
L_{\ell}(f \given \bx) = \mathbb{E}_{y_j\given\bx} \left [ \ell  (y_j, f_t(\bx)) \right ] \,,
$$
and  $L_{\ell}^*(\bx)$ is the minimum expected loss at point $\bx$.

If a node classifier is trained by a learning algorithm that minimizes a strongly proper composite loss, e.g.,  squared, exponential, or logistic loss, like in our implementation (see in Appendix \ref{sec:training_of_node_classifiers}), then the bound (\ref{eqn:estimation_bound}) can be expressed in terms of the regret of this loss function: 
$$
\left | \eta_T(\bx, t) - \psi^{-1}(f_t)  \right | \le \sqrt{ \frac{2}{\lambda}} \sqrt{\reg_\ell(f_t \given \bx)}
$$
where $\lambda$ is a strong properness constant specific for a given loss function (for more detail, see~\cite{Agarwal_2014}). By putting the above inequality into~(\ref{eqn:estimation_bound}), we get
$$
\left | \eta(\bx, j) - \heta(\bx, j) \right | \le \! \sum_{t \in \Path{j}} \! \left | \eta_T(\bx, t) - \heta_T(\bx, t) \right | = \!  \sum_{t \in \Path{j}}  \! \left | \eta_T(\bx, t) - \psi^{-1}(f_t)  \right | \le  \! \sum_{t \in \Path{j}}  \! \sqrt{ \frac{2}{\lambda}} \sqrt{\reg_\ell(f_t \given \bx)}
$$ 


\section{Tuning of hyperparameters}
\label{sec:hyper}


A \Algo{PLT} has only one global hyperparameter which is the degree of the tree denoted by $b$. The other hyperparameters are associated with the node classifiers. To tune the stochastic gradient descent described above we varied values of $\gamma$, $\lambda$, and the number of epochs. 
%
All hyperparameters were tuned by using the open-source hyperparameter optimizer \Algo{SMAC}~\cite{Hutter_et_al_2011} with a wide range of parameters, which is reported in Table \ref{tab:hyppar}. 
%We also tuned the number of epochs which is the number of times we run through the entire dataset. 
The validation process was carried out by using a $80/20$ split of the training data for every dataset we used.
